# MissCountOnResults
A mod that displays miss and their increase/decrease in the max combo section of the result screen.

You can use MissCountOnResults even if you don't have it, but I strongly recommend you get it.<br>
It must be my version, but I may submit a pull request.<br>
So, you might even be able to use the original one in the near future.
